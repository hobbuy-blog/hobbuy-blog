# @bockring's Profile #
## Greetings ##
Hi, I'm bockring. Welcome to my profile. I'm a Japanese teenager.

I am good at analog circuits, but I can write programs a little. So I sometimes upload sources. But only for Arduino(or devices loaded with Arduino's boot-loader).

## My projects ##
I sometimes make programs. Then I upload them. This is my projects, short descriptions, their latest version, and links.
|  Project Name  | Short Description | Latest Version |
| - | - | - |
| [ArduMark](https://github.com/bockring/ArduMark.git) | Benchmark softwares for Arduino | LTS V2.0 |
| [Apple-ExtensionPack](https://github.com/bockring/Apple-ExtensionPack) | Extension softwares for Apple's device | AssistiveTouch Plus+ |
| fx-Grapher | Draw graph on Python | Now developing... |
