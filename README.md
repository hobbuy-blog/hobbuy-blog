# @bockring's Profile #
## Greetings ##
Hi, I'm bockring. Welcome to my profile. I'm a Japanese teenager.

I am good at analog circuits, but I can write programs a little. So I sometimes upload sources. But only for Arduino(or devices loaded with Arduino's boot-loader).

## My projects ##
I sometimes make programs. Then I upload them. This is my projects, short descriptions, their latest version, and links.
|  Project Name  | Short Description | Latest Version |
